// • generates square matrices A and B of dimension at least 1000×1000 stored in row-major
// order.
// • computes the matrix product C = AB using each of your functions (note that you may
// have to prepare A and B in different data types so they comply with the function argument
// types). Your result stored in matrix C should be the same no matter which function defined
// at a) through d) above you call .
// • prints the number of rows of your input matrices, and for each mmul function in ascending
// order, prints the amount of time taken in milliseconds and the last element of the resulting
// C. There should be nine values printed, one per line
